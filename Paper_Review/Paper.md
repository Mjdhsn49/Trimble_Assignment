# Restormer: Efficient Transformer for High-Resolution Image Restoration

## Introduction

The paper  attached here addresses the difficulties encountered in image restoration, with a specific application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the challenges posed by image restoration problems. It points out the constraints associated with CNNs, including their ability to process information over l limited receptive fields and their inability to dynamically adjust to varying input content. To address these limitations, the paper introduces the self-attention mechanism of Transformer models. It has the capability to capture long-range interactions among pixels, which is crucial for image restoration tasks. However, it is highlighted that the computational load of SA grows quadratically with the spatial resolution, rendering it impractical for numerous image restoration tasks that involve high-resolution images.

## Proposed Method

The proposed Restoration Transformer (Restormer) is designed to overcome the challenges faced in image restoration tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across various image restoration tasks including image deraining, single-image motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, and image denoising. The architecture of Restormer incorporates multi-Dconv head transposed attention (MDTA) to capture long-range pixel interactions and model global connectivity. This allows the model to aggregate local and non-local pixel interactions efficiently for processing high-resolution images. Additionally, Restormer includes a gated-Dconv feed-forward network (GDFN) which performs controlled feature transformation, suppressing less informative features and allowing only useful information to propagate further through the network hierarchy. This gating mechanism enables network layers to focus on refining specific image attributes, leading to high-quality outputs.

The paper also introduces a progressive learning strategy for Restormer, where the network is trained on small patches and large batches in the initial training epochs, gradually transitioning to larger image patches and smaller batches in later epochs. This progressive training strategy enables Restormer to learn the context from large images and provides significant performance improvements at test time. Overall, Restormer presents a comprehensive approach to efficient image restoration, addressing the limitations of existing models by incorporating innovative design components and training strategies.


## Performance of the model

The proposed Restormer model represents a notable advancement in the field of image restoration, having superior performance across multiple image restoration tasks and outperforming existing methods. Its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results while maintaining computational efficiency is a significant accomplishment in and of itself. The Restormer model introduces innovative architectural designs and experimental choices that contribute to its success.

One of the key features of the Restormer model is its progressive learning strategy, which is instrumental in effectively restoring high-resolution images. This progressive learning approach enables the model to adapt and learn in a systematic manner as it processes and restores images, ultimately leading to enhanced restoration results for high-resolution images. By implementing this strategy, the Restormer model is able to capture and address the complexities of high-resolution image restoration in a more effective and efficient manner.

Moreover, the paper presents experiments that shed light on the impact of different components on the model's performance. These experiments provide valuable insights into the workings of the Restormer model and give the contributions of specific architectural elements and design choices. For instance, the experiments delve into the influence of multi-head attention and feed-forward network improvements, demonstrating their pivotal roles in enhancing the model's restoration capabilities. Additionally, the impact of design choices for the decoder at level-1 is explored, providing a deeper understanding of how these decisions influence the overall performance of the model.

Overall, the Restormer model's success can be attributed to its innovative architectural designs, experimental choices, and the adoption of a progressive learning strategy, all of which have collectively propelled it to achieve superior performance in image restoration tasks.

## Conclusion

Overall, the paper contributes to the field of image restoration by proposing an efficient Transformer model, Restormer, that addresses the challenges associated with CNNs and the ill-posed nature of image restoration problems. The model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple image restoration tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of its architectural designs and training strategies.

## Why this publication was interesting to you ?

This paper addresses a problem occured during my work at Master thesis and it's a future work. My thesis was on "Person Re-indentifaction". During my thesis work I had following problems

1. Addressing the motion blur frames, due to blur frames person tracking fails since I was using appearance based model.
2. I was using basic gaussian blur to smoothen the frames but as we know it's not effective in detailing the image frames through out video this paper address defocus deblurring.
3. During my work I was dropping all the frames which are too blurry just to not loose the tracking of person as the videos were recorded at 30 frames per second dropping few blur frames works to some extent but sometime due to shaky camera alot of frames are blurry dropping all those frames is not feasable using this paper work all these problems of my work could be solved which interested me.
